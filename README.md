Project for UCSD MAS Capstone Project


# About

This is the final project collection for Group 6 Cohort 6 (2021) of the University of California San Diego's Masters of Advanced Studies in Data Science and Engineering Program (UCSD MAS DSE).

The goal of this project is to apply data science principles to further optimize the San Diego Fire Potential Index (risk of a fire of consequence occurring given an ignition) calculation and 7 day forecast, specifically through development of a machine learning algorithm, flexible data design for incorporation of new features such as solar radiation from mesowest.utah.edu, and model validation procedure from GeoMAC Wildfire. 

This README aims to provide context for and instruction on how to use the work completed in this project for others who wish to leverage or adapt it. For a full summary of the work done and additional information, please refer to the Final Report document in this collection.
